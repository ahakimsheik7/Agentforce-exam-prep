## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents my structured and disciplined preparation for the **Salesforce Agentforce Specialist Certification**.

The objective of this repository is not only to prepare for the exam, but to deeply understand the architectural, configuration, and governance principles behind Salesforce Agentforce.

This documentation serves two core purposes:

1. A structured, domain-aligned certification study guide  
2. A professional portfolio demonstrating hands-on Agentforce configuration and applied prompt engineering practices  

All notes, examples, and breakdowns are written with implementation clarity and exam alignment in mind.
